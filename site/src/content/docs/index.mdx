  <Card title="Awareness, Not Access" icon="information">
    envpkt stores _metadata about_ secrets — what service each credential authenticates to, when it expires, how to
    rotate it — never the values themselves.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Environment Scanning" icon="magnifier">
    Auto-discover credentials from your shell with `envpkt env scan`. Matches ~45 known services, ~13 suffix patterns,
    and ~29 value shapes with confidence scoring.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fleet Health" icon="heart">
    Scan an entire directory tree of agents with `envpkt fleet`. Get aggregated health status, expiration warnings, and
    stale credential detection across your fleet.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Shared Catalog" icon="open-book">
    Define secret metadata once in a central catalog, then have each agent reference it. Resolve to flat configs for
    deployment with `envpkt resolve`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="MCP Integration" icon="puzzle">
    Built-in MCP server exposes credential metadata to AI agents. Four tools and two resources — no secret values ever
    exposed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Functional API" icon="seti:typescript">
    TypeScript library built on functype. All functions return `Either` or `Option` — no thrown exceptions. Use
    programmatically for boot, audit, fleet scan, and more.
  </Card>
