title: envpkt resolve
description: Resolve catalog references and output a flat, self-contained config
---

Resolve catalog references by merging catalog metadata with agent overrides, producing a flat config with no `catalog` field.

## Usage

```bash
envpkt resolve [options]
```

## Options

| Option                | Description                                 | Default       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `-c, --config <path>` | Path to `envpkt.toml`                       | Auto-detected |
| `-o, --output <path>` | Write resolved config to file               | stdout        |
| `--format <format>`   | Output format: `toml`, `json`               | `toml`        |
| `--dry-run`           | Show what would be resolved without writing | `false`       |

## Examples

```bash
# Resolve and print to stdout
envpkt resolve -c agent.toml

# Output as JSON
envpkt resolve -c agent.toml --format json

# Write to file
envpkt resolve -c agent.toml -o resolved.toml

# Preview without writing
envpkt resolve -c agent.toml --dry-run
```

## Merge Rules

- Each field in the agent's `[meta.KEY]` override **replaces** the catalog field (shallow merge)
- Omitted fields keep the catalog value
- `agent.secrets` is the source of truth for which keys the agent needs
- Configs without a `catalog` field pass through unchanged

See the [Catalog System guide](/guides/catalog-system/) for a detailed walkthrough.
