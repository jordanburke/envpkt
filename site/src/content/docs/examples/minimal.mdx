title: Minimal
description: The simplest possible envpkt.toml
---

The smallest valid configuration — one secret with a service name.

```toml
#:schema https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jordanburke/envpkt/main/schemas/envpkt.schema.json

version = 1

[meta.API_KEY]
service = "stripe"
```

This is enough to:

- Track that `API_KEY` authenticates to Stripe
- Run `envpkt audit` (will report `missing_metadata` for missing `expires`)
- Run `envpkt inspect` to view the config

## Adding More Detail

Incrementally add fields as you learn more about your credentials:

```toml
[meta.API_KEY]
service = "stripe"
purpose = "Process payments"
expires = "2027-01-15"
rotation_url = "https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys"
```

See the [TOML Schema reference](/reference/toml-schema/) for all available fields.
