## Key Patterns

- **`consumer = "service"`** — classifies this as a backend service (not an AI agent)
- **`rate_limit = "100/sec"`** — documents API rate limits for Stripe
- **Multiple SaaS providers** — Stripe (payments), SendGrid (email), Redis (caching)
- **Mixed sources** — `manual` for developer-provisioned keys, `ci` for infrastructure
