<Steps>

1. **Install envpkt**

   ```bash
   npm install -g envpkt
   ```

2. **Discover credentials in your environment**

   envpkt scans your shell for known credential patterns — API keys, tokens, connection strings — and reports what it finds:

   ```bash
   envpkt env scan
   ```

   You'll see a table with each detected variable, its inferred service, and a confidence indicator.

3. **Scaffold your envpkt.toml**

   Turn those discoveries into a config file:

   ```bash
   envpkt env scan --write
   ```

   This creates (or appends to) `envpkt.toml` with `[meta.*]` sections for each discovered credential.

4. **Audit credential health**

   Check expiration dates, staleness, and missing metadata:

   ```bash
   envpkt audit
   ```

   Exit codes: `0` = healthy, `1` = degraded, `2` = critical.

5. **Check for drift**

   Detect mismatches between your config and live environment:

   ```bash
   envpkt env check
   ```

   This runs bidirectional drift detection — secrets in TOML but missing from env, and credential-shaped env vars not tracked in TOML.

</Steps>

## Next Steps

- [The TOML File](/getting-started/the-toml-file/) — understand every field in `envpkt.toml`
- [CLI Reference](/cli/) — full documentation for all commands
- [Catalog System](/guides/catalog-system/) — share secret metadata across agents
